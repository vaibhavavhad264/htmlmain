    <h3>Website</h3>
    <p>Website is a collection of web pages, which are interlinked. The
        various web pages are prepared independently. And in the end they
        are linked in the required sequence depending on the logical
        makeup of information on the site. The link for a web page is
        basically a URL [Uniform Resource Locator]
        i.e the address of the computer where the web page is present.
        Such a collection of related web pages is called a website.
