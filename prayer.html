                    O God, help us to keep ourselves physically strong, mentally
            awake and morally straight, that in doing our duty to Thee and to
            our country we may keep the honor of the Service untarnished.
            Strengthen us to guard our country from external aggression and
            internal disorders. Awaken our admiration for honest dealing and
            clean thinking, and guide us to choose the harder right, instead of
            the easier wrong.
            Kindle our hearts with fellowship for our comrades at arms and
            with loyalty to the men we command. Endow us with the courage
            which is born of the love of what is noble and which knows no
            compromise or retreat when truth and right are in peril. Grant us
            new opportunities of service to Thee, to our country and to the men
            we lead, and ever help us to place such service above self.
        </p>
