    <h3>Features of HTML</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Each tag is enclosed within a <(left bracket) and >(right
            bracket). These special characters are what differentiate the
            tags from ordinary text
        </li>
        <li>
            Opening is denoted by<>, for example <I>.This is the
            opening tag to display text in italics.   
        </li>
        <li>
            Closing tag is denoted by </>, for example </I>. This is the
            closing italics tag.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tag names are not case sensitive but as a convention they are
            written in upper case so as to distinguish them from the
            normal text.
        </li>
    </ol>
