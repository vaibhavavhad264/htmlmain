        <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
        <p>
            In 1980, a mark up language was developed to create documents
            that could be displayed consistently on computers of different
            hardware and operating systems. It was called the Standard
            Generalized Markup Language or SGML on the web. HTML is
            used to construct formatted pages for the web known as web pages.
